## Configure Workshop
As the industry’s most tightly integrated support team and bot solution, Genesys DX uses AI to help your team be more effective and efficient, unburden employees from repetitive tasks, and provide seamless transitions from bots to live human support. It’s the best of both worlds.

Tying in the DX AI-powered knowledge bases enables you to build sophisticated knowledge that can be intelligently searched using APIs. In other words, you can author knowledge using the knowledge base so that it can be surfaced intelligently to customers via interaction with the bot flows.

You can create and maintain a knowledge base of questions and answers. When a user asks a question, Genesys DX AI looks for a similar question in the Knowledge Base. When a similar question is found, the corresponding answer is returned to the user. If the answer is not yet in the knowledge base yet, the user can escalate it to an agent via ticket or chat.

In this section we will be covering basic configurations of knowledge bases, chat and chat bots in the 3 following sections -

1. Construct a Knowledge base
2. Construct a Bot Flow
3. Tie it all together with a Message Flow
